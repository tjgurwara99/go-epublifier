A simple library to convert web novels / news articles into ePub files for your shiny kindle.

Since more and more of my recreational reading has been happening on Kindle these days,
and I quite enjoy reading webnovels/fan fiction by hobbyist writers, this library makes
it very easy to convert those webpages into ePub novels which can then be sent to your
Kindle over USB using Calibre tool.
